## Description: 

This repository acts as a container for code, database models and queries, written in the course of the collaboration between Viktor Bahr ([Eridian System](https://eridian.systems)) and the SchmitzLab.

It's also kind of a demo repository for learning git - I'll try to keep it as clean as possible, but don't expect too much ;)
